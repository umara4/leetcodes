/*Intuition
I had a few ideas. I was thinking I could I could get rid of the duplicates as I found them, or I could create a new vector without any duplicates.I decided to just create a new vector

Approach
Whenever I found a new value I would append it to my vector.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n)

Space complexity:
O(n)

public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        int s =nums.size();
        int i=1;
        int x=nums[0];
        vector<int> ans;
        ans.push_back(x);
        while(i<s){
            if (x!=nums[i]){
                x=nums[i];
                ans.push_back(x);
            }
            i++;
        }
        nums=ans;
