# Intuition
The problem requires rotating an integer array to the right by `k` steps. One way to achieve this is by reversing the array in three steps.

# Approach
The approach involves reversing the entire array, then reversing the first `k` elements, and finally reversing the remaining elements. This effectively rotates the array to the right by `k` steps.

1. Reverse the entire array.
2. Reverse the first `k` elements.
3. Reverse the remaining elements.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
  The approach involves reversing three portions of the array, each requiring linear time. Thus, the overall time complexity is linear, where `n` is the size of the array.

- Space complexity: O(1)
  The approach uses a constant amount of extra space for temporary variables, regardless of the input size.

# Code
```cpp
void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    k %= n;
    reverse(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    reverse(nums.begin(), nums.begin() + k);
    reverse(nums.begin() + k, nums.end());
}
