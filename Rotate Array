# Intuition
The problem requires rotating an integer array to the right by `k` steps. One way to achieve this is by reversing the array in three steps.

# Approach
The approach involves reversing the entire array, then reversing the first `k` elements, and finally reversing the remaining elements. This effectively rotates the array to the right by `k` steps.

1. Reverse the entire array.
2. Reverse the first `k` elements.
3. Reverse the remaining elements.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
  The approach involves reversing three portions of the array, each requiring linear time. Thus, the overall time complexity is linear, where `n` is the size of the array.

- Space complexity: O(1)
  The approach uses a constant amount of extra space for temporary variables, regardless of the input size.

# Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void rotate(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    k %= n; // Handle cases where k is larger than array size

    // Reverse the entire array
    std::reverse(nums.begin(), nums.end());

    // Reverse the first k elements
    std::reverse(nums.begin(), nums.begin() + k);

    // Reverse the remaining elements
    std::reverse(nums.begin() + k, nums.end());
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    int k = 3;

    rotate(nums, k);

    std::cout << "Rotated array: ";
    for (int num : nums) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
