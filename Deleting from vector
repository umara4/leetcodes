/*
Intuition
I was just thinking about whats the easiest way to delete values from a vector. I knew that c++ has an easy method to do this so I knew wanted to use the erase method.

Approach
I approached the problem by first taking the size of the vector. This was used in my while loop where I iterated through the vector and compared to the val. After going through it all, I also output the new size of the vector

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n^2)

Space complexity:
O(1)

Code

class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        int s = nums.size();
        int i = 0;

        while (i < nums.size()) {
            if (nums[i] == val) {
                nums.erase(nums.begin() + i); 
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }
        int n = nums.size();
        return n;
    }
};
